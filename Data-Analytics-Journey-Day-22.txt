ðŸ“˜ Topics & Explanations 

1. What is Big Data?
==================
Definition: Data that is too large, fast, or complex for traditional databases to handle.

Characteristics (3Vs + 2):
Volume â€“ Huge amounts of data.
Velocity â€“ High-speed data generation (e.g., social media, IoT).
Variety â€“ Structured, unstructured, semi-structured data.
Veracity â€“ Data quality & trustworthiness.
Value â€“ Insights extracted from data.

Example: Netflix processes petabytes of data daily to recommend movies.


2. Distributed Computing Basics
=============================
Definition: Multiple machines work together as a single system.

Why needed?: A single computer cannot store or process massive datasets.

Example: Google search runs on thousands of servers worldwide.


3. Hadoop Ecosystem
==================
HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) â€“ Stores big data across clusters.
MapReduce â€“ Processes data in parallel.
YARN â€“ Resource management.

Example: An e-commerce platform storing billions of product clicks.


4. Apache Spark
==============
Definition: A fast big data processing framework, much quicker than MapReduce.

Features:
In-memory computing.
Supports batch + streaming.
APIs in Python, Java, Scala, R.

Example: Uber uses Spark for real-time ride pricing and driver-passenger matching.


5. Real-World Case Study
=====================
Healthcare: Big Data + Spark analyze patient histories and predict diseases.
Finance: Fraud detection from real-time transactions.
Retail: Walmart uses Big Data to optimize inventory & sales trends.
